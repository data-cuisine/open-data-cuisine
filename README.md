# Open Data Cuisine

[Data Cuisine](http://data-cuisine.net) explores food as a means of communication and information expression.

This repository contains the "Open Data Cuisine" recipe â€” a set of materials and instructions so you can run your own Open Data Cuisine workshop, based on a workshop series conducted by Susanne Jaschko ([prozessagenten](http://prozessagenten.org)) and Moritz Stefaner ([Truth & Beauty](http://truth-and-beauty.net)).
